**General Conclusion:** Factors independent of teachers influence students' learning outcomes, motivating the exploration of alternative teaching methods.
Individualized instruction is too expensive for most students to be used on a large scale. Additionally, a key element of mastery learning is the focus on individual students rather than assessing group work.

**Result:**
2nd place
